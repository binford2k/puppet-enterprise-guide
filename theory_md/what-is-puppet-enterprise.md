Puppet Enterprise is an automation platform that enables the configuration of infrastructure through both model driven (desired state) and imperative task based (ad-hoc) approaches. The imperative ad-hoc approach enables you to get started with automation quickly by leveraging your existing investments in the form of scripts, in any language. The model driven approach leverages infrastructure as code expressed as a simple to understand language to define the desired configuration or “end state” of infrastructure with state being continually enforced and reported on. 

Here are just _some_ of the types of things you can use Puppet Enterprise for:


* Compliance and Server Hardening 
* Security baselines for OS and applications (CIS etc)
* Consistent build process
    * OS level system configuration
    * Ensuring essential system services are continually running
    * Firewall settings
    * File/user permissions
    * Application packages
* Complex Multi-tiered application deployment and supporting component configuration
* Patching
* Vulnerability management
* Agentless network device management
* Maintenance tasks:
    * Rotate logs
    * Back ups
    * Restart system services
