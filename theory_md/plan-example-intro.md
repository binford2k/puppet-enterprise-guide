## Info Workflow Plan

In this example we’ll walk through a basic Plan consisting of some inputs, and two steps - a Task and command.

The Task used within the plan accepts 3 parameters, **firstname**, **surname** and **age**. Once parameter values are input and the Task is executed, it will echo those parameter values to the console. In order to use the Task correctly, this Plan will need to accept inputs that correspond to those found in the Task.

We’ll combine this Task step with a simple command step within the Plan to build a “workflow”. 

Whilst trivial, it should help illustrate how to use and structure Plans for your own automation workflows.
