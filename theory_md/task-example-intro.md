## Personal Info Task

The **personal info** Task is a bash/powershell based script with some basic IF statements which validates Task parameter inputs and outputs a value to the console based on those inputs.

This simple Task accepts 3 parameters, **firstname**, **surname** and **age**. Once parameter values are input and the Task is executed, it will echo those parameter values to the console.

This is a trivial Task example but it should serve as an aid to help understand on how to build a Task and give you ideas about how you could adapt this for your own real world use. 

In this example weâ€™ll be using bash and powershell scripts but this could be any scripting language such as powershell, python, ruby etc.
